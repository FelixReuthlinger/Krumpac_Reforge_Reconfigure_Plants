# Reforge Plants Reconfigured

This mod serves some configs for some of the custom plants in [Reforge mod pack](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Krumpac/Krumpac_Reforge_Core/). You can use it as is or also change some values to your preferred values.

**WARNING**: this mod is made for use with the Krumpac Reforge modpack only, it includes dependencies to Reforge mods that contain PREMIUM-ONLY features.

## Features

* Using [ConfigurePlants](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/FixItFelix/ConfigurePlants/)
* Provides faster plant growth (50% of original grow time).
* Plants will use larger distances for being able to plants them. Yes, you will need more space to plant them, but since the plants all have colliders, at least with some more spacing, you can walk through your field.
* Supports farming mods that use the Valheim model values for calculating grids for placing the plants.
  * Recommendation to use [Farming](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/Farming/)
